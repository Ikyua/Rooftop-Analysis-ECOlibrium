# Rooftop-Analysis-ECOlibrium'

ECOLIBRIUM - Loisaida: Rooftop Analysis 2024 (Team: Kyle Silvestre, Khalil Allwood )

Objective: We focus on the albedo of a building's roof primarily in the future hope to find a way to reduce the urban island heat effect that cities tend to be affected by and by extension lowering the demand on energy, especially, during warmer periods in the year. Albedo is "whiteness" of a surface but more specifically it is a measure of how much light a surface can reflect when a light is shined upon it. The theory here is that having roof with a high albedo will cool the interior and surrounding area of the building, and consequently, lower the need for using electricity for cooling.
