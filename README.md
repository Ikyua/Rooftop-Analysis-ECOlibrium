# Rooftop-Analysis-ECOlibrium'

ECOLIBRIUM - Loisaida: Rooftop Analysis 2024 

Objective: Analyze rooftops to assess the Urban Heat Island effect, focusing on albedo (color), and it's impacton building temperature. 

Approach:
- Albedo Mapping:
  - Use albedo values to model energy consumption and temperature changes
- Rooftop Coverage:
  - Implement object detection and segmenation to anaylze rootftop coverage and features

Tools:
- Data Collection:
  - Screenshots of buildings from Google Earth in 2D.
- ML Frameworks:
  - PyTorch, Tensorflow
- Front-End
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Back-end:
  - Flask
