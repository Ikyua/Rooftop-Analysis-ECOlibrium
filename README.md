# ECOLIBRIUM - Loisaida: Rooftop Analysis 2024 

This project utilizes Flask and HTML to transfer images through each applications to produce and visualizle visual results to the user.


Albedo refers to the reflectivity or 'whiteness' of a surface, specifically how much light it reflects when illuminated. Our research focuses on estimating the albedo of building roofs using deep learning. The idea is that roofs with higher albedo can help cool the buildingâ€™s interior and surrounding environment, thereby reducing the need for energy-intensive cooling systems. In the future, we aim to explore ways to mitigate the urban heat island effect, which significantly impacts cities, ultimately reducing energy demand during warmer periods of the year.
