# Rooftop-Analysis-ECOlibrium'

ECOLIBRIUM - Loisaida: Rooftop Analysis 2024 (Team: Kyle Silvestre, Khalil Allwood )

Objective: Albedo is "whiteness" of a surface but more specifically it is a measure of how much light a surface can reflect when a light is shined upon it. We focus on the estimating the albedo of a building's roof using deep learning. The theory here is that having roof with a high albedo will cool the interior and surrounding area of the building, and consequently, lower the need for using electricity for cooling. In the future, we hope to find a way to reduce the urban island heat effect that cities tend to be affected by and consequently lowering the demand on energy for cooling; especially, during warmer periods in the year.
